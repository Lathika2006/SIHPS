E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea

The notification system in the E-Waste Facility Locator app uses location services to alert users about nearby e-waste events and updates. It sends real-time notifications when users are close to recycling events, drives, or facilities they frequent. This system promotes user engagement, encourages participation in recycling initiatives, and builds a community around sustainable practices.

##Find Recycling Centers: The website helps you find places near you where you can recycle old electronics.

##Learn About E-Waste: It teaches you why it's important to recycle electronics instead of throwing them away because they can harm the environment and people's health.

##Earn Points: You can enter the model of your old device, and if it's recycled properly, you get points based on the valuable materials recovered.

##Easy to Use: The website is easy to use, with a map showing nearby recycling centers and information about what they accept.

##Stay Updated: It keeps you updated on the best ways to recycle and offers rewards for recycling correctly.
